# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
The dataset provided (sales_full_data.csv) contains 12 months worth of sales data.

The aim of this project is to apply Data Cleaning and Data Visualization and answer the following questions:

Which month had the highest and lowest sales? What are the probable reasons for this?
At what time of the day would you put out advertisements so that sales increase?
What products were sold the most?
